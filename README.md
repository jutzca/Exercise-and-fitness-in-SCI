:memo: **Short summary:** A low level of cardiorespiratory fitness [CRF; typically defined as peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) or peak power output (PPO)] is a widely reported consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and a major risk factor associated with chronic disease. However, CRF can be modified by exercise. This systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression aimed to assess whether certain SCI characteristics and specific exercise considerations are moderators of changes in CRF. A primary meta-analysis was conducted including randomised controlled trials (RCTs; exercise interventions lasting >2 weeks relative to control groups). A secondary meta-analysis pooled independent exercise interventions >2 weeks from longitudinal pre-post and RCT studies to explore whether subgroup differences in injury characteristics and/or exercise intervention parameters explained CRF changes. Further analyses included cohort, cross-sectional and observational study designs. The outcome measures of interest were absolute (AV̇O2peak) or relative V̇O2peak (RV̇O2peak), and/or PPO. Four databases were searched up to March 2023. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool were used to assess bias/quality. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted. Of 21,020 identified records, 120 studies comprising 29 RCTs, 67 pre-post studies, 11 cohort, 7 cross-sectional and 6 observational studies were included. The primary meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in AV̇O2peak [0.16 (0.07, 0.25) L/min], RV̇O2peak [2.9 (1.8, 3.9) mL/kg/min] and PPO [9 (5, 14) W] with exercise, relative to controls (p<0.001). Ninety-six studies (117 independent exercise interventions comprising 1,331 adults with SCI) were included in the secondary, pooled meta-analysis which demonstrated significant increases in AV̇O2peak [0.22 (0.17, 0.26) L/min], RV̇O2peak [2.8 (2.2, 3.3) mL/kg/min], and PPO [11 (9, 13) W] (p<0.001) following exercise interventions. There were subgroup differences for RV̇O2peak based on exercise modality (p=0.002) and intervention length (p=0.01), but there were no differences for AV̇O2peak. There were subgroup differences (p≤0.018) for PPO based on time since injury, neurological level of injury, exercise modality and frequency. The meta-regression found that studies with a higher mean age of participants were associated with smaller changes in AV̇O2peak and RV̇O2peak (p<0.10). GRADE indicated a moderate level of certainty in the estimated effect for RV̇O2peak, but low levels for AV̇O2peak and PPO. This review may be limited by the small number of RCTs, which prevented a subgroup analysis within this specific study design. Our primary meta-analysis confirms that performing exercise >2 weeks results in significant improvements to AV̇O2peak, RV̇O2peak and PPO in individuals with SCI. The pooled meta-analysis subgroup comparisons identified that exercise interventions lasting up to 12 weeks yield the greatest change in RV̇O2peak. Upper-body aerobic exercise and resistance training also appear the most effective at improving RV̇O2peak and PPO. Furthermore, acutely-injured, individuals with paraplegia, exercising for ≥3 sessions/week will likely experience the greatest change in PPO. Ageing seemingly diminishes the adaptive CRF responses to exercise training in individuals with SCI.
